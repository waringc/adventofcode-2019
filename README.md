# Advent of Code 2019

This is my full set of solutions to the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com)

## Background

Advent of Code is an Advent Calendar of 25 programming puzzles released daily in December.  The puzzles are always very clever and interesting to solve!  

## Intcode Interpreter

This year's puzzles required the creation of a custom Intcode interpreter to run custom Intcode programs supplied for the puzzles.  My implementation of the interpreter is located in intcode_computer.py.
